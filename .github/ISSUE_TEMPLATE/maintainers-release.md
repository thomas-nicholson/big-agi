## Artifacts Generation

```markdown
You help me generate the following collateral for the new release of my opensource application
called big-AGI. The new release is 1.2.3.
To familiarize yourself with the application, the following are the Website and the GitHub README.md.
```

- paste the URL: https://big-agi.com
- drag & drop: [README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enricoros/big-AGI/main/README.md)

```markdown
I am announcing a new version, 1.2.3.
For reference, the following was the collateral for 1.1.0 (Discord announcement,
GitHub Release, in-app-news file news.data.tsx, changelog.md).
```

- paste the former: `discord announcement`,
- `GitHub release`,
- `news.data.tsx`,
- `changelog.md`

```markdown
The following are the new developments for 1.2.3:
```

- paste the link to the milestone (closed) and each individual issue (content will be downloaded)
- paste the git changelog  `git log v1.1.0..v1.2.3 | clip`

### news.data.tsx

```markdown
I need the following from you:

1. a table summarizing all the new features in 1.2.3 (description, significance, usefulness, do not link the commit, but have the issue number), which will be used for the artifacts later
2. after the table score each feature from a user impact and magnitude point of view
3. Improve the table, in decreasing order of importance for features, fixing any detail that's missing, in particular check if there are commits of significance from a user or developer point of view, which are not contained in the table
4. I want you then to update the news.data.tsx for the new release
```

### Readme (and Changelog)

```markdown
I need you to update the README.md and the with the new release.
Attaching the in-app news, with my language for you to improve on, but keep the tone.
```

### GitHub release

```markdown
Please create the 1.2.3 Release Notes for GitHub.
Use a truthful and honest tone, understanding that people's time and attention span is short.
Today is 2024-1-1.
```

Now paste-attachment the former release notes (or 1.5.0 which was accurate and great), including the new contributors and
some stats (# of commits, etc.), and roll it for the new release.

### Discord announcement

```markdown
Can you generate my 1.2.3 big-AGI discord announcement from the GitHub Release announcement?
Please keep the formatting and stye of the discord announcement for 1.1.0, but with the new messaging above.
```
